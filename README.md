# üì© Level-3-Task-2-Email-Spam-Detection-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-Classification (NLP)

## üìò **Project Overview**

This project focuses on developing a **machine learning model for email spam detection** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.
The goal is to automatically classify emails as either **spam** or **ham (non-spam)** based on the content of the message.

Through this project, I explored the complete NLP workflow ‚Äî from **text preprocessing** and **feature extraction** to **model training** and **evaluation**. The implementation demonstrates how data-driven approaches can enhance email filtering systems and protect users from unwanted or malicious content.

## üéØ **Objectives**

The main objective of this project is to build and evaluate a classification model capable of distinguishing between spam and legitimate emails.
Specific objectives include:

1. To perform **text preprocessing** (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
2. To convert textual data into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
3. To train and test multiple **machine learning classification algorithms**.
4. To evaluate model performance using **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
5. To visualize and interpret the classification results for insight and validation.
